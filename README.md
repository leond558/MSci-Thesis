# Masters-Thesis-ML-and-Diffusion-MRI

• Used Gaussian mixture models, generalised linear models and sklearn to analyse diffusion MRI data from COVID-19 patients.
• Tuned expectation-maximisation at the algorithmic level to draw abnormality maps 10x more sensitive than existing diagnostics
in locating brain regions severely affected by viral infection.
• Summarised my conclusions in a clear and comprehensive paper awaiting publication with support from the Cavendish
Laboratory and the Cambridge Medical Research Council.
